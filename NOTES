This is the first public release of Idiopidae in a form that other
people can use.  It's still rough as I'm still learning my Python,
but writing this in Python has been great so far.  Right now Idiopidae
has all the features I need to work on my book and to document 
Idiopidae itself.  These include:

* Named or anonymous sections of code via simple export comments.
* Inclusion of sections based on the file and the name.
* Formatting input with Pygments which is either guessed or explicit.
* Formatting of the output can also be guessed or explicity.
* Simplistic line numbering which will be changed to use Pygments' own setup.
* Reasonably fast without doing any on-disk caching of the compiled results.
* Full API to allow parsing a document and analyzing the contents via sections.
* Complete (or nearly) test suite using nose.

You use Idiopidae by simply running the idio script against an input "prose"
document with include statements.  This script then parses the prose and
tries to find the files/sections you want to include.  It then writes
the results to stdout for you to view or store.  Something like this:

  > idio doc/src/index.page > sample.page

Future versions will include a simple building tool and the ability to set
options.
