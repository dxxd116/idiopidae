      <h1>Idiopidae: code is code; prose is prose.</h1>


	<p>Idiopidae is my attempt at finally releasing something that 
makes it easier for technical documentation authors to write.</p>


	<p>The purpose of Idiopidae is to keep the code in the code, 
and the prose in the prose, and then merge the two together
based on very light comments in the source.</p>


	<p>You can see the <a href="//index.html">original <span class="caps">HTML</span></a> of this file as well as the
<a href="/idiotest/test.html">final output</a> to compare the two</p>


	<h2>Concepts</h2>


	<p>Idiopidae works on the idea that in your &#8220;prose&#8221; file you&#8217;ll
put <em>include</em> statements as comments, and in your &#8220;code&#8221; file
you&#8217;ll put <em>export</em> statements to mark off regions of code that
need to be named.</p>


	<p>When you run the <strong>idio</strong> Python script on your prose file, it
follows the <em>include</em> statements and loads the file and section
you specify into an output result.  It will also format it with
the <a href="http://pygments.org/docs/quickstart/">Pygments</a> library
to produce nice typsetting (currently defaults to <span class="caps">HTML</span>).</p>


	<p>This file you&#8217;re reading right now is simply a <a href="http://hobix.com/textile/">Textile</a>
prose file that includes and describes Idiopidae&#8217;s source.
The process for creating it was:</p>


<blockquote>
	<p>cd doc
	webgen
	idio output/index.html  &gt; output/test.html</p>

</blockquote>




	<p>The source is available from a Bazaar repository at:</p>


	<pre><code><a href="http://www.zedshaw.com/repository/zapps">http://www.zedshaw.com/repository/zapps</a></code></pre>


	<p>As currently just a demo of <a href="/projects/zapps">Zapps</a> but it
will be moved into its own project folder soon as it is good
enough to use and distribute.</p>


	<h1>The Runtime</h1>


	<p>It&#8217;s best if we start with the runtime.py file, which is responsible for
using the IdiopidaeParser to process the files.  It starts off with your
typical boilerplate code but I like the with statement so I include some
future stuff:</p>


<blockquote>
<pre>
### @include "idiopidae/runtime.py" 1 html
### @end
</pre>
</blockquote>

	<p>Next we need to keep track of stuff:</p>


<blockquote>
<pre>
### @include "idiopidae/runtime.py" "Builder Class" html
### @end
</pre>
</blockquote>

	<p>Now, there&#8217;s three methods that the parser uses heavily
during the parsing phase to chunk up a document into the
proper structure for later analysis:</p>


<blockquote>
<pre>
### @include "idiopidae/runtime.py" "Main Methods: include, export, append" html
### @end
</pre>
</blockquote>

	<p>These aren&#8217;t used by callers so much as by the IdiopidaeParser
and the Composer.  These methods then use:</p>


<blockquote>
<pre>
### @include "idiopidae/runtime.py" "next_statement" html
### @end
</pre>
</blockquote>

	<p>To swap into the next statement and:</p>


<blockquote>
<pre>
### @include "idiopidae/runtime.py" "append_current_export" html
### @end
</pre>
</blockquote>

	<p>To append each export to a list of exports found.</p>


	<p>The process we&#8217;re describing involves the IdiopidaeParser
using the Builder under the direction of the Composer:</p>


<blockquote>
<pre>
### @include "idiopidae/runtime.py" "Composer Class" html
### @end
</pre>
</blockquote>

	<p>It is built with a simple loop in the idio file that
acts as a binary for users to run:</p>


<blockquote>
<pre>
### @include "bin/idio" 1 html
### @end
</pre>
</blockquote>

	<p>First we have how a file is loaded and parsed by
the composer:</p>


<blockquote>
<pre>
### @include "idiopidae/runtime.py" "How Files Are Loaded" html
### @end
</pre>
</blockquote>

	<p>which is actually used by the <strong>process</strong> method:</p>


<blockquote>
<pre>
### @include "idiopidae/runtime.py" "How Files Are Processed" html
### @end
</pre>
</blockquote>

	<p>This is the most complex method since it is where all
the real work is being done.  It loads the file we
want to compose, and goes through all the sections.
Any section that&#8217;s an export is just printed out, but
any section that&#8217;s an import is processed as another
call to <strong>include</strong> and <strong>format</strong> to get the text:</p>


<blockquote>
<pre>
### @include "idiopidae/runtime.py"  "Formatting Lines With or Without Numbers" html
### @end
</pre>
</blockquote>

	<p>The <strong>include</strong> method is actually very simple:</p>


<blockquote>
<pre>
### @include "idiopidae/runtime.py" "How Other Sections Are Included" html
### @end
</pre>
</blockquote>

	<p>And that&#8217;s all of idiopidae except the parser, which we&#8217;ll
go over next.</p>


	<h1>The Parser</h1>


	<p>The parser is the key to how Idiopidae works and it uses
the <a href="/projects/zapps/">Zapps</a> that I adopted recently.  It
shows you can easily crank out little parsers for little
languages that are fast enough for real work.</p>


	<p>Since most people don&#8217;t get parsers, you could do good to
use <a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/">bzr</a> to grab the code and study
how this file is translated into the idiopidae.py file.</p>


	<p>Every parser generator has three main components: code stuff,
tokens, and grammar rules.  For Idiopidae there&#8217;s not much
code stuff than the import of the runtime:</p>


<blockquote>
<pre>
### @include "idiopidae/parser.g" starter html
### @end
</pre>
</blockquote>

	<p>Then we just start off the parser declaration, which will
be turned into a class named <em>idiopidae.IdiopidaeParser</em>
that you can run:</p>


<blockquote>
<pre>
### @include "idiopidae/parser.g" grammar html
### @end
</pre>
</blockquote>

	<p>Now, we need to have a bunch of tokens which we want to 
either discard as just visual aids for the user, or keep
as input data:</p>


<blockquote>
<pre>
### @include "idiopidae/parser.g" tokens html
### @end
</pre>
</blockquote>

	<p>You can&#8217;t tell from the above list what it is dropped and what
is kept, for that you have to look in the grammar.  The trick
is we define all the base &#8220;words&#8221; or tokens and then we use the
grammar to sift through them to pull out what is considered <em>Junk</em>
or a <em>Statement</em>:</p>


<blockquote>
<pre>
### @include "idiopidae/parser.g" rules text
### @end
</pre>
</blockquote>
